# RESUME — r2-hive (hive-worker)

Updated 2026-06-09 (owned by hive). Master save (read-only ref):
`claude-fleet/fleet-context/FLEET-CONTEXT-SAVE.md`.

**Role:** the hive runtime. North-star: **ONE hive codebase usable everywhere**, built on
**core's no_std crates** + thin per-platform layers (Linux/cloud, ESP32-S3/DFR1195, Uno-Q, wasm).
"Bring hive up to a general tool" = converge r2-hive (today Linux/std) onto that one codebase —
do NOT fork per-target firmwares. Chain: specs → core → hive. composer orchestrates hives, isn't one.

**Current branch:** `platform-trait` (local + pushed). Built atop the v0.2 work (`0aa6ab7`).

## Done + green
- **v0.2 migration + relay handshake + 4 vector fixtures** — full r2-hive suite GREEN; on
  `v0.2-relay-handshake` (pushed). Fixtures all specs-verified + landing: host-api (28),
  usb (specs), usb-pair (12 → canonical home **R2-PROVISION §5.3.4**), plugin-web (11, Ed25519).
  Generators: `crates/r2-hive-bin/examples/gen_{host_api,usb_pair,plugin_web}_vectors.rs`.
- **core D3a synced + relay driver CONFIRMED** (`3c5ba9c`) — core's WebSocketTransport §4.4.1 fan-out +
  UDP-LAN are now REAL (core `52b0e4e`). hive's relay driver (`compat/handshake.rs`: v0.1/v0.2 Ed25519
  handshake → `peers().connect()`→OutboundRx, `push_inbound` on recv, drain `outbound_rx.next()`→ws.send,
  `remove_peer` on cleanup) builds + runs GREEN against the real machinery (was scaffold). One core
  API-drift fix: `WebPluginManifest.subscriptions` added to 3 test manifest builders. Full suite green.
- **USB spec citations resolved** (`4c70d2c`,`8f31231`) — usb_pair/usb/main/usb_serial/usb_hotplug/api.rs
  all R2-HIVE §6.4.x → R2-PROVISION §5.3.4 (specs ruled it the canonical pairing home); R2-USB v2→v0.1.
  Type-byte divergence: specs RULED **ratify** as R2-USB §3.2.1 (don't drop; collision-free). Both
  wire extracts (type-byte table + CAPS + legacy detection; PAIR_* msg vocab + CBOR layout) committed
  `docs/r2-usb-wire-extract-for-specs.md` (`5232e61`) + sent to specs. Spec authoring is Roy-gated.

## In flight — Platform-trait extraction (north-star convergence step 1)
Split today's std hive → `r2-hive-core` (no_std+alloc host loop) behind a `Platform` trait +
thin platform layers (linux first). Verifiable on Linux now; foundation for esp32/wasm/unoq.
- DONE seams: 1 = clock (`69ab8fb`), 2 = RNG (`04d19cc`), 3 = **transports** (`1e24da8`):
  `src/platform.rs` (`Platform` trait + `LinuxPlatform`); `HiveState.platform` (default,
  no `new()` sig change); `src/transport_seam.rs` (`HiveTransports` trait = outbound
  multi-transport contract, `HiveState` impls it, `&dyn` proven). 100 lib tests + full suite green.
- DONE: **sync host-loop seam** (`sync_host.rs`, `683241f`) — `SyncTransport` trait
  (`kind`/`send`/`poll_recv`) + `TransportAddr`/`InboundFrame` + `provisional_hive_id` +
  `poll_inbound` tick primitive; Linux-verified via sync-stub. **TRANSITIONAL local mirror** of
  the seam core+hive AGREED (R2-DISCOVERY §5 sync). Core will EXTEND r2-transport
  (`Transport::poll_recv` default-None + TransportAddr/InboundFrame) → then delete the mirror,
  import `r2_transport::`. Host resolves source_addr→hive_id; driver-owned RX buffer.
- DONE: **RouteEngine wired into the sync host loop** (`route_inbound_sync`, `3ebdb61`) — parse
  R2-WIRE → ingest neighbour → `plan_forward` → execute Drop/DeliverOnly/Directed/Flood over
  `SyncTransport`; routing-only (no ensemble/TG/WS host bits); host-centralised resolution
  (specs-confirmed conformant, R2-DISCOVERY §5). Linux-verified end-to-end (real RouteEngine +
  sync-stub relay). 106 lib tests, full suite green.
- DONE: **`r2-hive-core` crate split started** (`a05b108`) — new `#![no_std]`+alloc crate (deps
  r2-wire/route/fnv only, no tokio/axum/std-net); **`sync_host` moved into it and compiles no_std**
  = PROOF the routing host-loop is MCU-portable. bin depends on it + re-exports `sync_host`
  (zero churn). Full workspace green (r2-hive-core 6 tests + bin suite).
- DONE: **Platform + transport seams migrated into r2-hive-core** (`234fd60`) — `Platform` trait
  (clock+RNG) → `core/src/platform.rs` (no_std), `LinuxPlatform` impl stays in bin + re-exports trait;
  `HiveTransports` outbound seam → `core/src/transport_seam.rs` (async-trait, no_std+alloc, needs
  `alloc::boxed::Box`), `HiveState` impl + `&dyn` trait-object test stay in bin (`hive.rs`).
  r2-hive-core builds no_std; full workspace green (100 bin lib + 6 core tests). Pushed.
- DONE: **storage seam migrated into r2-hive-core** (`b42658c`) — `core/src/identity.rs` (no_std+alloc):
  `MasterSecret` derivation (HKDF-SHA256 → hive_id/DEV_PK/DEV_SK), `DerivedIdentity`, fingerprint, UUIDv4,
  web-auth-key + the seam itself (`IdentityStore` trait, `StoreBackend`, platform-neutral `StoreError`
  replacing `io::Error` at the trait boundary). bin keeps std stores (`FileStore`/`KeyringStore`/
  `auto_store` + permissions/XDG/getuid), impls the core trait (io→StoreError), re-exports core types
  (mgmt::identity::* unchanged). RNG stays platform-side (getrandom→`from_bytes`); `bytes()` →
  documented storage-only `expose_secret_bytes()`. ed25519-dalek/hkdf/sha2/zeroize added to core
  default-features=false. r2-hive-core no_std; full workspace green (94 bin lib + 13 core tests).
- DONE: **OTA-receiver seam in r2-hive-core** (`354f395`) — `core/src/ota.rs` (no_std), the portable
  half of the firmware receiver: constants (OTA_PORT 21043/CMD_*/STATUS_*/PREAMBLE_LEN),
  `OtaPreamble::parse` (image_len u32 LE + sha256[32]), `OtaError` CODEs (PREAMBLE/TOO_BIG/BAD_MAGIC/
  SHA_MISMATCH/WRITE_FAIL/NO_SLOT/SHORT) + alloc-free `encode_reply/ok/error`, `FirmwareSink` trait
  (storage seam = flash I/O), `OtaReceiver` state machine (TOO_BIG bound-check BEFORE begin, streaming
  SHA-256, verify→finalize, abort-on-error). NOT a migration (no OTA code existed in bin) — built from
  core's `platforms/esp32/src/ota_tcp.rs` reference + composer's OTA-REPLY-STATUS-CONTRACT. 11 tests.
  Heads-up sent to composer to confirm CODE set / push-side framing. **Platform supplies:** embassy-net
  byte reads + esp-storage `FirmwareSink` impl (device); host uses a RAM mock. CMD_QUERY handled by
  platform layer (build info), not core.
- NEXT: with routing/identity/OTA cores all no_std + **5 seams** in place (sync_host, platform,
  transports, identity, ota), the convergence's host-side factoring is largely done. Remaining is
  firmware-tier (gated): swap `sync_host` seam mirror → `r2_transport::` when core EXTENDs r2-transport
  (poll_recv default-None + TransportAddr/InboundFrame); esp-hal/embassy board crate (P0) + esp-storage
  FirmwareSink + embassy-net OTA host loop (needs xtensa toolchain + hardware + core D3b).

## Next major phase — D2: DFR1195 (ESP32-S3) firmware, Path B pure no_std (esp-hal/embassy)
Gated on the convergence above + core's D3b. Sketch: `docs/esp32-hive-firmware-architecture.md`.
- Firmware = core's no_std stack + core's **D3b** no_std SYNC radio bindings, wrapped in an
  esp-hal/embassy host loop. Consume **R2-TRANSPORT SYNC** (R2-DISCOVERY §5), not async §4.
- hive owns: board layer (SX1262 LoRa / LCD / IO18 button), on-device host loop, **no_std OTA
  receiver** (embassy-net; std `ota_tcp.rs` is reference only). **Validation handoff:** core
  authors D3b but can't flash — **hive validates on real DFR1195**, feeds defects back.
- Near-term scope flag: r2-def/ensemble/dispatch are std-tier → initial MCU hive is
  ROUTING+TRANSPORT only (no on-device ensembles) until those are re-tiered no_std.
- References (std, patterns not code): core `platforms/esp32`, workshop `firmware/esp32-s3`.

## Pending Roy / cross-repo
- ~~Roy: greenlight R2-PROVISION §5.3.4~~ DONE — specs confirms COMMITTED (`4b74b20`, v0.6, Roy
  green-lit) on `spec-conformance-v0.2`. Cite by paragraph name (no §5.3.4.y sub-numbers).
- ~~hive TODO: usb_pair.rs citation fix~~ DONE (`4c70d2c`) — usb_pair.rs §6.4.x → R2-PROVISION
  §5.3.4 (SAS verification/Link key/Reconnect/Key agreement); main.rs+usb_serial.rs "R2-USB v2" →
  "R2-USB v0.1", SYNC frame → §3.3. Doc-only; builds clean.
- ~~OPEN: type-byte divergence + usb.rs frame-vocab mapping~~ RESOLVED — specs RULED: (A) ratify the
  type-byte sublayer as **R2-USB §3.2.1** (don't drop; discriminators collision-free by construction);
  (B) PAIR_* vocab + CBOR frame fmt home = **R2-PROVISION §5.3.4** (message vocabulary). usb.rs re-cited
  (`8f31231`); both wire extracts committed + sent to specs. **Awaiting Roy go-ahead** for specs to
  author the §3.2.1 amendment + §5.3.4 message subsection (impl stays as-is meanwhile).
- **Deps:** core **D3b** (no_std sync BLE/WiFi/LoRa) = hard blocker for radios; composer = OTA
  push + carrier + ensemble; specs = hw test defs.
- Phase-3 adversarial-refuter role (deployment reality): FILED first batch to specs (the 5
  high-value TN conjectures). Two systemic findings — (A) must_text bounds by TTL/time, never
  MEMORY (MCU RAM = fixed tables+eviction; fixed-size dedup evicts before window W); (B) hop-TTL
  ≠ wall-clock (a carried frame's hop-TTL never decrements while carried). Verdicts:
  TN-L2-IT-BL-001 + TN-L2-IT-AB-001 FALSIFIED-as-stated; BL-002/XT-BL-001/L1-IT-BL-004 REFINE.
  + sim-tier-decidability flag (sim needs bounded-mem + carry-time model, else mark tier=hardware).
  Awaiting specs adjudication; more conjectures can be reviewed on request.
  DYN-family batch (v0.3, 13 conjectures) ALSO filed: grounded vs real r2-route (f32 + libm::expf,
  multiplicative c+0.2*(1-c), mobility is an engine INPUT not RSSI-classified). Findings: (A)
  TN-L0-IT-BL-100 spec-vs-impl — must_text additive +0.1 vs impl multiplicative +0.2*(1-c) [core
  reconcile]; (B) TN-L2-IT-BL-100 RSSI-sigma classifier UNREALIZED + fragile under real RSSI noise
  → tier=hardware [strongest]; (C) soft-float expf cost on no-FPU (ESP32-C6); (D) fixed-point future
  → 0.05*(1-c) underflow (TN-L2-IT-BL-101). DYN batch ADJUDICATED by specs (`a9c28b1`): 3 new
  R2-ROUTE issues (8→11) — additive-vs-multiplicative BLOCKED+Roy-gated, RSSI-sigma re-tiered
  HARDWARE, expf/fixed-point forward-flagged.
  **BATCH 3 FILED** (`d161054`, docs/phase3-tn-refutation-batch3.md) — un-refuted SCF + XT/entanglement
  cells, grounded in real r2-route + r2-harness code. Key: RouteEngine has NO buffer/queue/entanglement
  (ForwardAction lacks a Queue variant; no-path → Drop(NoViableNeighbour) = silent drop); entanglement
  is SIM-ONLY (r2-harness live:bool, honesty #6; r2-trust §7 = no keep-alive/@entangled routing).
  Verdicts: TN-L2-IT-BL-002 FALSIFIED (no queue); TN-L2-IT-AB-000 FALSIFIED for carry>60s dedup;
  TN-L2-XT-BL-001 OOM-guard not sim-decidable (re-tier hw); all XT-AB cells test sim gate not
  authenticated crossing (passes-while-violating-spirit); BL-101 CONFIRM / BL-100 FALSIFY (no
  heartbeat → entangled-but-unreachable on duty-cycled links); XT-AB-001 undecidable (no instance id);
  XT-BL-100 'kept' conflicts w/ 30min route eviction.
  **BATCH 3 ADJUDICATED** (supervisor, verdict-of-record; catalogue write pending perm): IT-BL-002
  ACCEPT-FALSIFIED → R2-ROUTE #7 (MUST → named SCF layer, DUAL bound RAM×TTL; engine silent-Drop OK at
  routing layer); IT-AB-000 ACCEPT-FALSIFIED → operative rule = IT-AB-001 (idempotency at dispatch);
  IT-BL-000/XT-BL-000 = PRODUCTION-UNREALIZED (sim tests logic only, lifts no impl signal); XT-BL-001
  ACCEPT not-decisive → experiment revised (inject buffer cap; true OOM=hardware); XT-AB cells honesty-#6
  (authenticated-crossing MUSTs deferred to r2-trust §7 production); **XT-BL-100 entangled-but-unreachable
  = HEADLINE** → BLOCKED impl-missing (§7.3 keep-alive DEFINED-unimplemented); 3 Roy options, supervisor
  recommends implement §7.3 minimal keep-alive (decay-exemption REJECTED-leaning — contradicts BL-101);
  XT-AB-001 ACCEPT sim-undecidable → instance/epoch id (harness + R2-TRUST §7.6, Roy-gated); XT-BL-100
  NOT-falsified CLARIFIED (record-retention §7.3 vs route-eviction R2-ROUTE 2.5 both defined, no conflict).
  Remaining open cells: IT/XT main-path L0/L1/L3 functional cells (lower deployment-lens value) on request.

## Resume hygiene
Keep this current. WIP-checkpoint + push `platform-trait` periodically. Safe git only:
named `git add` / `git add -u` — never `git add -A`/`.`; never stage secrets.
